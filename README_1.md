Robogals 2018 Winter Hackathon Enterance: Detective McGriff.

McGriff the detective dog has been damaged and its up to you to fix him!

This is an educational resource designed for Robogals UQ, who's goal is to encourage young women to enter STEM degrees. This workshop is designed as an introduction to Ardunio for first time users with some prior block programming experience.

Thank you to the hardworking team of Anthony Love, Oliver Darvas and Hayden Wen for helping put this togeather and allowing us to take out first prize.
